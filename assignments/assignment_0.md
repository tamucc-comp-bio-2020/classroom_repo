  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can't get Ubuntu running._ After logging in, You are in your home directory. 
     
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```
  * It's always a good idea to keep your apps in `Ubuntu` up to date. _The first time you do this, it could take a long time to finish. After that, if you do this when you log in, it should go quickly._
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

## Description of Assignment

We have a steep learning curve to traverse, so we are going to "flip" the classroom next week. Flipping the classroom means that you work on the material to be covered before we address it in lecture.  Then we can spend time in lecture going over the most challenging topics, as identified by you. Then we will continue together in lecture through new material that builds upon this assignment.

Your assignment is to work through [Software Carpentry's The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) from Introducing the Shell through Working with files and directories.

## Resources to Help You

I highly recommend that you print out the [Linux Cheat Sheet](../resources/CheatSheetLinux_8-12-2016.pdf) which I created for myself and my students when I was learning `bash`.  It's unique because it translates english into `bash`.
